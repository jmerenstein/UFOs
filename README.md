# An Analysis of UFO Finder

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to utilize Javascript to create a website where users can input certain search criteria on the UFO Finder website to see a list of different UFO sightings. Thos website initially only allowed users to input a date to search for UFO sightings, but with this project I added the ability to search by city, state, country, and shape. This will allow users to more specifically search for sightings based on the criteria that they want to see. 

## Results
Users can click on the link [here](file:///Users/joshmerenstein/Desktop/Class/UFOs/index.html) to access the UFO Finder site. From here the users can scroll down and on the left hand side of the page they can see all of the different search options available on the site. There are filler examples of what types of searches will work so that the users will know how to search for certain criteria. For example if the users want to search by state they can search by state abbreviations. The filler text has "ar", for Arkansas, as an example so that the users will know if they want to search for UFO sightings in California they just have to put in ca. These filler texts are helpful for showing what types of search criteria will work.

## Summary
- One drawback of this webpage is that the users cannot search by certain keywords or article titles. There is nowhere on the search options where if a user knew about what a specific UFO sighting was called or what the comments were on it that they could search by those criteria.
